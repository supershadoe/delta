          stale-pr-message: |
            Due to no activity on this PR for over 2 months, this PR has been marked stale.

            Stale PRs increase overhead on maintainer's side and also quickly grow outdated as the
            codebase changes, thus making merging harder.

            If this PR is still relevant and required, make sure the PR is rebased over the current
            code.
          close-pr-message: |
            This PR has been closed by the stale bot as no activity was observed.

            Please create a new issue if the issue still persists.
